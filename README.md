Material-UI "Fitness"/TODO app

This app follows the "Fitness App" tutorial via FreeCodeCamp and using Material-UI (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/meet-your-material-ui-your-new-favorite-user-interface-library-6349a1c88a8c/). I took some liberties, but it is mostly verbatim. If you are following this tutorial, keep in mind that it was published over three years ago, so be sure to cross reference your code to mui.com. All in all, I like MUI and will be using it in future projects.
